I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. My primary research interests are in Labor Economics, Public Economics, Applied Econometrics. Specifically, my research focuses on immigration policy, non-wage benefits policy, health care sector strikes and role of employer in advancing racial diversity among medical trainees.
