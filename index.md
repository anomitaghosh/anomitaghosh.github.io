I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. My primary research interests are in Labor Economics, Public Economics, Applied Econometrics. I study how individuals and institutions respond to state and local policies that aim to promote inclusivity in labor markets.
