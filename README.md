### I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. My primary research interests are in Labor Economics, Public Economics, Applied Econometrics. Broadly, I study how individuals and institutions respond to state and local policies that aim to promote inclusivity in the labor markets. Specifically, I focus on immigration policies, non-wage benefits policies, public sector strikes, network effects in hiring, and the role of decision-makers in public sector hiring -- in the context of developed countries.
