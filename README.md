### I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. My primary research interests are in Labor Economics, Public Economics, Applied Econometrics. Specifically, I study whether public policies can improve the functioning of labor markets, and the impact of those policies on health and racial inequities.
